**This article will deploy a Web application onto AWS using ECS (Elastic Container Service) and ECR (Elastic Container Registry). We start by creating the docker image of our application and pushing it to ECR. After that, we create the instance and deploy the application on AWS using ECS. Next, we ensure the application is running correctly using Application Load balancer endpoint.**
